# Discord-Status-Rotater
Usage:
Run PackageInstaller.bat then run main.py, put in your discord token and the delay between the status switches, then just leave the file open and it will constantly change.
If you want to go one step further you can host it 24/7 on a site and keep it running all day without having the file open.
